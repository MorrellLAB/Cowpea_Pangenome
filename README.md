# Cowpea_Pangenome
This repository includes code used for comparisons of core and noncore genes and for [VeP](https://uswest.ensembl.org/info/docs/tools/vep/index.html) (Variant Effect Predictor) analysis in the cowpea pan-genome project.

The cowpea pangenome manuscript is available on [bioXriv](https://www.biorxiv.org).

*   Assemblies, annotations, variant calls (SNPs and indels) for 7 genomes are available [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iQaLW4SLmN2lP7q4k3uovHK3SvsxGbVi)
*   The physical positions for iSelect SNPs relative to each genome assembly are avaiable in this [repository](https://github.com/MorrellLAB/cowpea_annotation)
*   Cowpea pangenome assemblies and annotation are also avaialble from the Joint Genome Institute [here](https://phytozome-next.jgi.doe.gov/cowpeapan)
*   Larger files from the project will be available from a [DRUM](https://conservancy.umn.edu/drum) repository.
